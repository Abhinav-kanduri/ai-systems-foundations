# Large Language Model (LLM) Concepts

This section explains the **foundational intelligence layer** of modern AI systems: Large Language Models (LLMs).

The focus here is on **how LLMs think**, not how to use specific APIs or libraries.

## What Is an LLM?

A Large Language Model is a neural network trained to model language by predicting the next token in a sequence.
It learns linguistic structure, semantics, and reasoning patterns from large-scale text corpora.

## Core Concepts

- Tokenization & vocabulary construction  
- Embedding spaces & semantic representation  
- Transformer architecture  
- Self-attention & multi-head attention  
- Positional encoding  
- Instruction following  
- Chain-of-thought reasoning  
- Few-shot & zero-shot learning  

---

## Knowledge Characteristics

- Knowledge is **static** (frozen at training time)
- No awareness of real-world changes
- No direct access to external systems
- Relies on probability, not truth

---

## Limitations

- Hallucinations when facts are missing
- No source attribution
- Limited short-term context window
- No execution or action capability

---

## Why This Layer Matters

LLMs are the **reasoning engine** behind all higher AI abstractions:
RAG, Agents, and Agentic AI all build on this layer.
