# AI Agent Concepts

This section introduces **action-oriented AI systems** that can reason, decide, and execute tasks.

---

## What Is an AI Agent?

An AI Agent is a system that combines:
- Reasoning (LLM)
- Knowledge access (RAG)
- Action execution (tools, APIs, code)

---

## Core Capabilities

- Task decomposition
- Planning & execution loops
- Tool use (APIs, databases, services)
- Code execution
- File interaction
- Real-time information retrieval
- State tracking

---

## Reasoning Patterns

- ReAct (Reason → Act → Observe)
- Retrieval-guided planning
- Query-term planning
- Feedback loops

---

## Memory Concepts

- Short-term task memory
- Long-term episodic memory
- Context awareness across steps

---

## What Agents Are NOT

- Not autonomous goal setters
- Not self-improving
- Not multi-agent systems

---

## Why This Layer Matters

AI Agents transform AI from **answering questions** to **doing work**.
