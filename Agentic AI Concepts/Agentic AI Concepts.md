# Agentic AI Concepts

This section describes **autonomous, self-directed AI systems** composed of multiple agents.

---

## What Is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to systems that:
- Define goals
- Plan autonomously
- Coordinate multiple agents
- Adapt via feedback

Minimal human intervention is required once goals are set.

---

## Core Concepts

- Autonomous goal planning
- Multi-agent collaboration
- Role assignment & delegation
- Hierarchical task execution
- Feedback-driven adaptation
- Long-term memory sharing
- State propagation

---

## Multi-Agent Patterns

- Planner agent
- Executor agent
- Retrieval agent
- Critic / evaluator agent
- Memory agent

---

## Communication & Coordination

- Agent-to-agent protocols
- Shared memory spaces
- Task orchestration
- Lifecycle management

---

## Risks & Challenges

- Runaway autonomy
- Debugging complexity
- Cost explosion
- Safety & alignment issues

---

## Why This Layer Matters

Agentic AI enables **end-to-end autonomous systems**, not just intelligent tools.
