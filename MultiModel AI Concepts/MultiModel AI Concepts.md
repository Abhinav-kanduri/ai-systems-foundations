# Multimodal AI Concepts

This section explains how AI systems understand and reason across **multiple data modalities**.

---

## What Is Multimodal AI?

Multimodal AI processes and integrates:
- Text
- Images
- Audio
- Video
- Structured data
- Sensor data

---

## Core Modalities

- Text (NLP, reasoning)
- Vision (image & document understanding)
- Audio (speech & emotion)
- Video (temporal reasoning)

---

## Representation Learning

- Shared embedding spaces
- Cross-modal embeddings
- Contrastive learning
- Modality alignment

---

## Fusion Techniques

- Early fusion
- Late fusion
- Cross-attention fusion
- Hierarchical fusion

---

## Multimodal RAG

- Image-text retrieval
- Video segment retrieval
- OCR + reasoning pipelines
- Grounded multimodal answers

---

## Why This Layer Matters

Real-world intelligence is **not text-only**.
Multimodal AI brings perception into AI systems.
